## 1. Building the Authorization Server

1. **Creating the authorization route** - In `authorization-server.js` create a new empty server route that accepts `GET` requests to the `/authorize` endpoint using the `app.get` method. The empty route should return a `200` status by default, using the `res.end()` method.
2. **Verifying the client ID** - Next, get the `client_id` param from the `req.query` object and verify if the client ID exists by checking the `clients` object in the same file. If the client ID does not exist, respond with a `401` status code using the `res.status` method. If the client ID exists, return a `200` status.
3. **Validating the scopes requested** - After the client ID is validated, we need to ensure that the requested scopes are a subset of the allowed scopes for the client. For example, the client with ID `"my-client"` is allowed to request for the `"permission:name"`, and the `"permission:date_of_birth"` scopes. The requested scopes are available in the `req.query.scopes` parameter as a space separated string. We can split this string into it's individual scopes by using the `req.query.scope.split(" ")` method. You can use the `containsAll(arg1, arg2)` function imported from the `utils.js` file to check if the array `arg1` contains all the elements of the array `arg2`. If requested scopes are not a subset of the allowed scopes, return a `401` status code.
4. **Storing the request** - Now that we have verified all the client credentials and scope, we need to create a request ID and temporarily store the request object to use in the next section. You can see an empty `requests` object already declared in the file. We need to create a random string as the request ID, which will be the key stored in the `requests` object, with the value being the `request.query` object. To help you generate a random string, you can use the `randomString()` function in the `utils.js` file.
5. **Rendering the login page** - We now need to render the login page for the user to login to our system. You can render the login page using the `res.render(page, params)`. The `page` argument can be set to `"login"` which will render the `assets/authorization-server/login.ejs` template file. The `params` argument is needed to supply parameters to the template file.
